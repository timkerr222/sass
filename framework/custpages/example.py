    You can literally write whatever you want and build a streamlit app to whatever you are trying to do
    Examples could be:
        - Simple display of a dataframe
        - Showing set of charts and graphs
        - Simple Data App
        - Or complicated, sophisticated full streamlit application with multiple pages!
